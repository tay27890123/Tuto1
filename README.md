**Learning Project**  
Bachelor of Economics | University Malaya

##  What I Learned
- Creating synthetic dataset using `itertools.product()` and `np.random`
- Data cleaning and feature engineering
- Creating dummy variables (`degree_dummy`)
- Groupby, pivot tables and calculations (`employment_gap`)
- Data visualization with Matplotlib & Seaborn

## Tools Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook in VS Code

##  Project Highlights
- Generated 70 rows of synthetic employment data (7 countries × 5 years × 2 education levels)
- Calculated employment gap between Degree and Non-degree holders
- Created beautiful visualizations

**Status**: Learning project completed (Visualization stage)
